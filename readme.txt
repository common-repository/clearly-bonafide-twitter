cb-twitter is a clearly bonafide WordPress widget that creates a stream of your latest tweets.

== Description ==

This Twitter widget is very customizable - set the number of tweets to show, display profile thumbnails, exclude replies and more.

It works with newer versions of WordPress, unlike many ! If issues do arise however, please let me know and I will address these issues as soon as possible.
